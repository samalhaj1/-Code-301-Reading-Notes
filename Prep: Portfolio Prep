* My name: Samera Mohammad AL Youssef ( Sam Al Haj)
* Nationality: Syrian
* The Background:  I am 26 years old. My family and friends call me Sam.
I studied classroom teacher, but circumstances wanted me to finish my third year at university and travel to Jordan. 
I did not give up and tried with everything I had to complete my studies then I got a scholarship and studied translation. 
I graduated in 2018 from Zarqa Private University. Now I am studying at Abdul Allah Alghorair School for Advanced Computing as a scholarship. 
I hope to get much experience which may make me an excellent developer.
OS version number: Windows 10 Education (19042.1052).
Why I am excited for this course: it is natural for anyone to be excited about this course as it concerns the programming world, which has occupied all areas of our lives, so I was very excited when I heard about it. 
And I hope to be able to connect it with my field of translation and find a way to do so. I also hope that it will give me many job opportunities in the future.
