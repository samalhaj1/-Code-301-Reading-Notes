## 1. Who is Roy Fielding?


He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

## 2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

because to get to a machine that we can have a meaningful conversation with, it needs to know as much as we do, have the same level of reasoning, but also think at the same speed. Such a sweet spot is pretty much impossible to hit, let alone sustain. Progress is exponential, and even if such a machine exists one day, it will soon be surpassed.

## 3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

 it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web.

## 5. What does a POST do?
