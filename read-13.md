## 1. What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?

The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

## 2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. It became the story we told ourselves about the computing revolution. 

It helped define who geeks were, and it created techie culture.
## 3. What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?
More than of %50 interested in technology

Males are using the internet more than females.

females are using social websites more than male .

## 4. When are diversity efforts most successful?
Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders

## 5. Why do diverse companies perform better?
When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. 

When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, 

for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.

## 6. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

When Tracy Chou of Pinterest shared the company’s demographic information last year, 

she explained: "We only stand to improve the quality and impact of our products if the people building them are representative of the user base and reflect the same diversity of demography, culture, life experiences and interests that makes our community so vibrant."
