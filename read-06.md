## 1. What is node.js?

Node. js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications.

Node. js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.


## 2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
V8 is the name of the JavaScript engine that powers Google Chrome. It's the thing that takes our JavaScript and executes it while browsing with Chrome. 

V8 provides the runtime environment in which JavaScript executes. The DOM, and the other Web Platform APIs are provided by the browser.

## 3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. 

In other words, Node. js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return

## 4. What is npm?

npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently. 

It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases. Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs

## 3. How does pair programming work?

pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. 

The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
